              Designing Circuits is a project dedicated to
              teaching the application of analog and digital circuits.
            </p>
            <p>
              My name is Sergio Silva, and I attend the University of Illinois
              at Urbana-Champaign, Class of 2018, where I study Electrical
              Engineering. My passion lies in circuit design, mainly analog.
              I have taken courses in analog/digital IC design, power electronics,
              RF circuit design, and control systems. Here is a copy of my
              <a href="www.google.com">resume.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              With this website, I hope to improve my circuit design skills as
              well as help others who wish to learn more about circuits. I post
              articles and projects on my sparetime, but it becomes harder to do
              so during the school semester. Each of the included projects on the
              site are my own works, and they make for good projects that teach
              you about that circuit. The articles are meant to give you the
              background knowledge in order to understand the projects, but once
              you know enough, you can also make your own project!
            </p>

              If you have any further questions or have feedback on how improve
              the site, please contact <a>designingcircuits@gmail.com</a>

              I would very be glad to read and to respond to all comments.
              Thank you for your interest.
