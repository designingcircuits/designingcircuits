      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        DesigningCircuits is a project dedicated to teaching you about the
        applications of analog and digital circuits.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is something I would have liked to have had when I first started learning about electronics.
        When you first learn about electronic circuits, it just seems like a bunch of math,
        which bores a lot of people (me included). However, if you can see beyond
        that, you'll find that there is much more to circuits than just solving KVL
        and KCL. It is the application part that intrigues people. How cool is it that
        you can build your own bench power supply or make a speaker amplifier for your phone?
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to build your own electronics, then you have to start somewhere,
        and I am here to help you. On this site, I post circuit articles and projects
        on how to design circuits. The articles are meant to give you the
        background knowledge in order to understand the projects, but once
        you know enough, you can also make your own project!
      </p>
      <p>
        What I do differently from other circuit websites is that I try to provide
        enough clarification on the projects. On other sites, more often than
        not, I see projects that just consist of displaying a schematic
        with a description and a component list, but there isn't much to learn from that.
        I believe the best way to learn is for someone to explain how each part of the circuit
        works as well as important design aspects, such as "Why is there a capacitor here?
        What's its purpose?"
      </p>

        My name is Sergio Silva, and my dream is to become an analog circuit designer.
        By making this site, I hope to help others who want to know more about circuits
        and to improve my circuit design skills. I'm an electrical
        engineering major at the University of Illinois
        at Urbana-Champaign, class of 2018. My coursework revolves around circuits,
        if you haven't guess already. I have taken courses in analog/digital IC design,
        power electronics, RF circuits, analog/digital signal processing, control systems,
        and FPGA programming.

        If you have any further questions or have feedback on how improve
        the site, please contact designingcircuits@gmail.com

        I would be very glad to read and to respond to all comments.
        Thank you for your interest.
