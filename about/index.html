            Designing Circuits is a project dedicated to
            teaching the application of analog and digital circuits.

          <p>
            My name is Sergio Silva, and I attend the University of Illinois
            at Urbana-Champaign, Class of 2018, where I study Electrical
            Engineering. My passion lies in circuit design, mainly analog.
            I have taken courses in analog/digital IC design, power electronics,
            RF circuit design, and control systems. Here is a copy of
            <a href="www.google.com">resume.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            With this website, I hope to improve my circuit design skills as
            well as help others who wish to learn more about circuits. I post
            articles and projects on my sparetime, but it becomes harder to do
            so during the school semester. Each of the included projects on the
            site are my own works, and they make for good projects that teach
            you about that circuit. The articles are meant to give you the
            background knowledge in order to understand the projects, but once
            you know enough, you can also make your own project!
          </p>

            the site, please contact <a>designingcircuits@gmail.com</a>

            I would very be glad to read and to all respond to all comments.
            Thank you for your interest.
