            Designing Circuits is a project dedicated to teaching the application of analog and digital circuits to those who are interested in electronics. I believe that the best method to learn about circuits is by experiencing them. The ability to design a circuit based solely on your knowledge and experience is fascinating. However, circuit design is not easy and involves a great deal of effort.

            My vision for Designing Circuits is to create a guide that demonstrates various circuit applications for those who want to learn more. This site may be small right now, but with time, it will become the perfect resource for the aspiring circuit designer.

           "Sergio Silva is currently a sophomore in Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His passion lies in circuit design, mainly analog. His circuit background comes from the courses he has taken such as analog/digital IC design, power electronics, and wireless communication systems. In his sparetime, he often finds himself reading about and looking at different types of circuits. When he wants to take a break, he spends his time cruising the campus town streets on his longboard enjoying the air breeze."
